# Plan
Copy this repo for each participant. For now, each participant will create a new annotation set on their own version of the repo.


TODO
* Come up with scenarios that represent different common programming tasks
* Ask participants what they would like to see while coding/want to communicate to future readers of the code
* Try asking different types of participants -- serious programmers vs students
* Can we help people work with synthesized code?
*
